"""The words a mandi trade is made of.

Not a list of anyone's clients and nothing to do with the invoice ledger —
just the vocabulary of the trade itself: the units goods are counted in, the
commodities dealt in, and the little words that carry who sold to whom.

A recogniser given these in advance is markedly better at them. Whisper takes
an `initial_prompt` in the style of the expected speech and a `hotwords` list
it will lean toward, and both are decoding hints rather than a lookup: a word
outside this list is still transcribed, just without the help.
